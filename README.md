# B1RK4 solver for the bilinear single-degree-of-freedom	oscillator response to arbitrary base acceleration excitation.

# 1. Introduction

\verb|B1RK4| is a standalone executable program written in C++ that calculates the response of a bilinear single-degree-of-freedom oscillator to an arbitrary base acceleration input via the fourth-order Runge-Kutta formulation. It can be used in standalone mode, or in conjunction with third-party software. It may find application in parametric, stochastic analysis and optimisation, and can assist learning on the subject of structural dynamics.
